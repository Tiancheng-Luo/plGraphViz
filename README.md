plGraphViz
==========

Easily export graphs represented as Prolog terms to
 [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/).
The Prolog terms have the following form:

~~~prolog
graph(Vertices, Edges, GraphAttrs)
~~~

`Vertices` and `Edges` are lists of compounds terms of
 the following form:

~~~prolog
vertex(Id, VertexAttrs)
edges(FromId, ToId, EdgeAttrs)
~~~

`Id` identifies a vertex and need not occur in any of the edges
 (i.e., unconnected vertices are allowed).
`FromId` and `ToId` may occur in the list of vertices,
 in order to draw an edge between vertices with set attributes.

Attributes have the form `Name=Value`.
`GraphAttrs` are attributes of the graph.
`VertexAttrs` are attributes of the vertex.
`EdgeAttrs` are attributes of the edge.

Attribute values are given as Prolog terms as well,
 and are type-checked before exporting.
Many of the GraphViz attributes are supported.
New ones are added on an as-needed bases
 (open an issue on Github if you want to see a specific feature added).
Supports HTML-like labels, allowing complex tables to be shown
 inside vertices.
Support for vertex clusters is currently under way.

### Example

~~~prolog
$ swipl run.pl
?- use_module(plGraphViz(gv_file)).
?- graph_to_gv_file(
     graph([vertex(1,[]),vertex(2,[])],[edge(1,2,[])],[]),
     File,
     [method(sfdp),output(png)]
   ).
   File = 'PATH/plGraphViz/data/tmp.png'
~~~

The graphic can be saved to a different file by instantiating
 the `File` argument.

### 'Method' option

Option `method(+atom)` sets the drawing method that is used by GraphViz
 to place the vertices and edges.
The following values are supported.

| **Value**       | **Description**         |
| `circo`         | Circular layout.        |
| `dot` (default) | Directed graph.         |

---

### 'Output' option

Option `output(+atom)` sets the type of file the graph is written to.
The following values are supported.

### HTML-like labels

Example of using HTML-like labels:

~~~prolog
graph_to_gv_file(
  graph(
    [vertex(1,[]),vertex(2,[label=html(table([tr([td(a),td(b)]),tr([td(c),td(d)])]))])],
    [edge(1,2,[label='From 1 to 2.'])],
    []
  ),
  File,
  []
).
